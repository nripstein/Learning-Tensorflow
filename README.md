# TensorFlow Tutorial
These are my Jupyter Notebook files as I learn tensorflow using [Daniel Bourke's Tensorflow Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpCFfeUEGs8&amp). It is a [two part series](https://youtu.be/ZUKz4125WNI) over 14 hours in duration.  After the free content on youtube, I began taking notes on the full 64 hour course.
